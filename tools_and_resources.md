# Digital Humanities Tools and Resources

## Introduction

This guide provides download links to the major software we will be using for the Fulbright/IACER programme in June 2017. It also provides general links to useful resources.

### DH Community

The [Association of Digital Humanities Organisations (ADHO)](http://adho.org/) is the umbrella organisation for DH societies around the world. It includes CenterNet, which sponsors [DH Commons](http://dhcommons.org/), a useful resource for learning about projects and finding collaborators. ADHO also sponsors the [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH)](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) Special Interest Group, which helps break down barriers that hinder communication and collaboration among researchers in high, mid, and low income economies.

The Slack DH community is another option for getting support (see Team Communication Tools below). There is also an increasing number of tutorials in DH tools and techniques available on the [Programming Historian website](http://programminghistorian.org/).

[Digital Humanities Now](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/) is an experimental, edited publication that highlights and distributes informally published digital humanities scholarship and resources from the open web. Individuals can volunteer to be Editors-at-Large for set periods. This is a great way to learn about what is happening in the world of DH.

Creating local DH communities is also important. One way to do this is to organise a [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org/) (The Humanities and Technology Camp). Guidelines for organising a THATCamp can be found [here](http://thatcamp.org/help/organize/).

[HASTAC](https://www.hastac.org/) is a social media platform that encompasses the DH community and sister communities in the arts, digital writing, and digital pedagogy.

The DH community _lives_ on Twitter. See the Social Media section for accounts to follow.

### General DH Tools and Resources

It is not possible to list all tools used for DH study. A good place to find them is in the [DiRT (Digital Research Tools) Directory](https://dirtdirectory.org/). Alan Liu's [Digital Toy Chest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools) is another option.

## Text Editors

A text editor is a program that allows you to edit files in plain text format. Your operating system comes with a text editor (called Notepad on Windows) already installed, but it has limited usefulness. Since all programming languages are written in plain text, developers have created many text editors with built-in functions to help coding. You should download one of these editors for use on your own system. I recommend starting with [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). To download it, click on the link appropriate for your system (most Windows users should use the 64 bit version). To install it, double-click the icon in your downloads folder. Note: Sublime Text 3 is an evaluation version, although there is no limit on how long you can evaluate it. When you save files, you will occasionally see a request to purchase the software. You can just click **Cancel**. If you find these messages annoying, you could try Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ([Windows Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) | [Mac Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)). Installation instructions are provided on the linked pages.

Both Sublime and Visual Studio Code are powerful application with many features and options for customisation. They can be a little overwhelming. But their basic function is just to allow you to type text or code and save it.

## Web Browsers

There are many options for browsing the web. If you have a Windows machine, it will come with Microsoft's Internet Explore or, more recently, Edge. If you have a Macintosh, it will come with Safari. I do not recommend using these products (especially the Microsoft ones) since they do not always conform to internet standards. This can lead to unpredictable behaviour. For Digital Humanities work, it is best to use one of the following:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

Just click the download link, and then double-click the installation icon in your downloads folder. Firefox and Chrome frequently trade places in terms of which is most stable and which incorporates the latest web standards. You may choose whichever you prefer, but it helps to have both installed on your system.

## Office Software

"Office software" refers to suites of productivity tools, the most important of which are word processors and spreadsheet programs. The most common suite is Microsoft Office, which includes Word and Excel. If users do not have Microsoft Office, there are a number of free options, including [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/). Increasingly, Google's suite of tools in Google Drive is becoming a viable alternative, although you need a Google account. See discussion under Collaboration Tools for setting this up.

## Bibliography

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an online bibliography database which has the ability to ingest bibliographical references straight from the web and to format references according to common citation guidelines (e.g. MLA, Chicago, APA). Instructions for installing Zotero can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation). Zotero is also a useful tool for maintaining collaborative bibliographies. You can set up a free account and create group bibliographies online.

## Collaboration Tools

Tools for collaboration fall into a number of categories, of which a few are mentioned here.

### Collaborative Writing and Cloud Storage

There are many options out there, but the most commonly used is Google docs. If you do not already have a Google account, create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp). Once you have an account, go to [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/). This will give you access to Google Drive, the cloud storage for Google docs, sheets, and other productivity tools. You can create documents and spreadsheets and share them so that others can edit them at the same time over the web. There are many guides online for how to do this.

Because Google provides cloud storage, it overlaps with tools that are more specifically dedicated to storing files. One of the most commonly used is [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). This allows you to sync a folder on your computer to one in the cloud so that others may view or edit files stored on your local computer, and you can access them any computer with internet access. Google Drive and Dropbox have storage limitations for free access, but you are unlikely to exhaust them unless you have _very_ large amounts of data.

### Video Chat

Google Drive comes with [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), in which you can create video chat sessions over the internet for free. Microsoft's [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) is the most well-known alternative, and it may already be installed on your computer. You will need a Google or Microsoft account, respectively, to use these services.

### Team Communication Tools

These tools are something like combinations of all of the above, plus Twitter and Facebook. When you are working on a specific project, they faciliate communication between your team. The most well-known tool is [Slack](https://slack.com/is). Even if you do not have a project where you can use Slack, it is worth getting an account because there is an active Slack DH community. For more information, see Amanda Visconti's ["How the Digital Humanities uses Slack to support and build a geographically dispersed intellectual community"](http://literaturegeek.com/2016/07/13/digital-humanities-slack-london-school-economics). To join, provide your e-mail address [here](http://tinyurl.com/DHslack).

The major complaint users have about Slack is that free accounts only allow you to retain access to the 10,000 most recent posts. If that is an issue, [Ryver](https://ryver.com/) is alternative which does not place that limitation, and my students have used it successfully to communicate for group projects.

There are also applications for project management, of which [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a popular option. I have generally found Slack and Ryver more useful, but Trello is particularly good at scheduling and setting benchmarks and milestones.

### Version Control Software

In software design, it is of utmost importance to have a history of modifications to the code (version control), but this can be useful for traditional writing projects as well. The computer programming industry has produced software for version control, of which the most popular is "git". This should not be confused with [GitHub](https://github.com/), which uses git to manage content in a cloud storage system. GitHub is probably the most commonly used platform for managing software "repositories" with version control. In fact, the document you are reading now is housed in a GitHub repository. The system works like this. You have a file on your local computer which is synced to a repository on GitHub. If you modify the file, you can "commit" the changes and then "push" them to the repository. If you decide that you didn't want the changes, you can role them back using git.

GitHub has a number of advantages:

1. It has a website and client applications which allow you to perform many git functions without learning git, which is not always easy. To get started, follow the tutorial [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You can download the client [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. GitHub has free public cloud storage. You'll need a paid plan if you want private repositories). DH is ideologically committed to open access, so this is rarely a problem.
3. GitHub has a social media-like "Issues" feature which is great for collaboration.
4. GitHub also has an optional features called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to host a website in a GitHub repository.

It can take time to get familiar with git and GitHub, but it is definitely worth it.

### Command-Line Access

Nothing to download here. These are just some links to how to access and use the command prompt. In Windows, press the &#8862; + `R` to bring up the **Run** box and type `cmd.exe` into the text field. Then hit the `Enter` key. A black command prompt window should appear. You can also type &#8862; + `X` and then `C` for short. On a Mac, the command prompt is called the **terminal**. To access it, run the cursor to the top of the screen to expose the menu bar. Then click the Spotlight icon (magnifying glass) at the top right. Alternatively, you can press &#8984; + `Space`. Start typing "terminal" in the search field. After two or three characters, the terminal icon will appear.

### Text Analysis Tools

Text analysis tools use various methods to manipulate and study text files. They may be web-based (run through a web browser), desktop tools, or they may be run through the command line.

#### Web-based Tools

- [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/)
- [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/)
- [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)

All of these tools can also be run locally with varying degrees of difficulty. Voyant-Tools can be run locally with [Voyant Server](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/resources/run-your-own/voyant-server/). Lexos and Palladio require Python to be installed on your computer. Complete instructions for installing Lexos are available [here](https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos/tree/master/0_InstallGuides). Documentation for installing Palladio locally is limited, but there are instructions [here](https://github.com/humanitiesplusdesign/palladio).

#### Desktop Tools

- The [GUI Topic Modeling Tool](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html) (click the link for installation instructions). This runs MALLET (see below) in the background.
- [Antconc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/)

### Command Line Tools

For topic modelling, most Digital Humanists use MALLET (see the [Programming Historian tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) for download and installation instructions). The GUI Topic Modeling Tool listed above provides access to most MALLET functions, so you don't need to use MALLET unless you find something that it can't do.

For other types of text analysis, you will generally need to use a programming language like Python or the statistical programming language R. Python is much easier to learn, but, if you are interested in R, a good place to start is [Matthew Jockers _Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature_. Springer, 2014](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319031637).

### Python

Python is a programming language that is relatively easy to learn. It is particularly popular with the data science, machine learning, and natural language processing communities, which have considerable overlap with DH. There are many ways to install Python on your system. I recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which comes with many of the modules you will need for DH research.

> #### Which version of Python should I download?
> There is no right answer two this question. Version 2.7 is the stable version and is generally a good option. If you want to run Lexos locally, you should have Python 2.7. Python 3 is slightly different. In the future, most applications will be written in Python 3, but it will not be standard for some time. Luckily, Anaconda makes it possible to run both at the same time. I suggest starting with Python 2.7 and adding Python 3 if you need it. If you are installing Lexos, it is best to do it in tandem with installing Anaconda. Complete installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos/tree/master/0_InstallGuides).

Installation of Anaconda is fairly straightforward. Just locate the installer for your system (see link above), download it,  and double-click it. Once it has finished installing, open a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows). Type python `print("hello")` and hit `Enter`. Make sure you use straight quotes, not curly/smart quotes. If you get "hello" printed back to you, the Python installation was successful.

Anaconda comes with many of the Python libraries (also known as "modules" or "packages") you may need. You can find a complete list of pre-installed packages [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs). If you need to install a package such as `chardet`, which is not included by default, open a command prompt and type `conda install chardet`. If the name of the package is not in the list type `pip install package_name` will work in most cases. Generally, tools like Lexos will list which packages they require in their documentation.

Python can be run from the command line, a web application, or from a Jupyter Notebook (formerly called an iPython notebook). This allows you to execute Python commands in a web browser. To start a Jupyter notebook, open a command prompt and type `Juypyter notebook` followed by `Enter`. In a moment, a web browser should open with the Jupyter notebook dashboard. 

For web applications, see under Developing on Localhost and Internet Hosting below.

### PHP

PHP is a programming language that forms the backbone for blog and blog-like platforms such as Wordpress, Scalar, and Omeka. Typically, it is used to create database-driven platforms using the MySQL database language (occasionally referred to by its open source name MariaDB). An easy way to install both together is with the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) distribution.

To install it, just locate the installer for your system (see links above), download it,  and double-click it. You can choose version 5.x to be safe or try version 7.x to be cutting edge. Wordpress should work with version 7.1, though some old Wordpress plugins might need updating. To start PHP, you need to activate it in the XAMPP control panel. When you finish installing, you will have the option to start the control panel. Do this. Then click **Start** across from Apache (that’s the server). If you are going to install Wordpress, you’ll also need to start MySQL. When you are done working with the server, click **Stop** in the control panel. In Windows, you can search for the control panel to open it using the Windows key. I presume you can locate it on a Mac by typing “XAMPP Control Panel” in the search bar.

Once you have Apache running, open a text editor and type the following:

```php
<?php echo "Hello world!"; ?>
```

Locate where you installed XAMPP and search inside the XAMPP folder for a folder called “htdocs”. This is where all your PHP files should go. Save the file as “hello.php” inside the “htdocs” folder. Then open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1/hello.php or http://localhost/hello.php (which may be easier to remember). If your browser says “Hello world!”, your PHP installation works.

### Developing on Localhost

The term `localhost` is used to describe a local server which you can use to develop web content that requires server-side languages such as PHP and Python. Both languages have built-in localhosts, but they are typically activated in different ways. For PHP, the easiest method is to use XAMPP to activate its Apache server. For Python, it is best to follow the instructions given for whatever package or tool you are using.

The URL (web address) for localhost is http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost. Often a port number will be added, such as http://127.0.0.1:5000. This will allow you to run multiple localhosts on different ports at the same time. You must start the localhost server before these addresses will work.

Websites created on localhost have one-way access to the internet. They can read material off the internet, but their content cannot be accessed by internet users. This makes them good for development purposes, but you will need an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to publish material to the internet.

### Hosting on the Internet

Most internet service providers (ISPs) provide access to PHP and MySQL out of the box. They typically also have easy methods for installing Wordpress from [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.com/). In general, you will want to pay for hosting, which typically also allows you to purchase your own domain (e.g. "http://scottkleinman.com"). But there are free alternatives that are worth considering. [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) provides free Wordpress hosting, although it has severe limitations on how much you can customise your site. Another option is [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/), which was created by the DH community. Humanities Commons provides fully customisable Wordpress installations for free, and it also offers a digital content repository service (see Repositories below). If you just want to host web pages, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is an option. All of these services will assign your website an address like "https://yourname.hcommons.org/", although Wordpress.com and GitHub pages provide the option to use your own domain if you have purchased it separately. Ownership of domain names typically has to be renewed every year (although it is automatic, unless you cancel). 

Hosting Python is a little bit tricky, as most internet providers do not provide access to Python out of the box. I recommend [Reclaim Hosting](http://reclaimhosting.com/) for this in part because I have got Python working successfully on their system. Like Humanities Commons, Reclaim Hosting was born in the academic community and is dedicated to academic usage. For that reason, I also recommend it even if you want to host static web pages or Wordpress. Reclaim Hosting also allows you to host your own version of Scalar (see Blogs, Content Management Systems, and Digital Exhibit Platforms).

There are many commercial ISPs which may offer services comparable to Reclaim Hosting. I do not list any here because many options may be available locally in Nepal.

### Digital Repositories

A digital repository is a cloud storage system intended to preserve content and making it discoverable. This can include traditional publications saved as PDFs, images, or data sets. Many universities are encouraging faculty to deposit research in their own institutional repositories. But the [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/) CORE repository makes a digital repository available for all Humanities scholars and students, regardless of their institutional affiliation. This makes for an excellent alternative to institutional repositories, which cannot be support by all institutions of higher education.

Another option is [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), originally created for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Zenodo automatically assigns a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to your work, which makes it easy to cite. In Digital Humanities Research, it is probably best used for software and data sets.

### Blogs, Content Management Systems, and Digital Exhibit Platforms

The two most dominant blogging platforms are probably Wordpress and [Blogger](https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/1623800?hl=en) (run by Google). Both create a subdomain for your on wordpress.com or blogspot.com, although Wordpress will allow you to use you own domain name (for a price on Wordpress.com), if you have one. See the comments under Hosting on the Internet and the separate Installing Wordpress section. Other blogging platforms such as [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) are worth looking at.

Most blogs are built around content management systems (CMS), which store content in a database, retrieve on demand, and build web pages around it. The [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) content management system is often used in the DH community for more sophisticated CMS-based applications. I can't recommend it because it is challenging to learn, but Quinn Dombrowski's recently published _[Drupal for Humanists](http://drupal.forhumanists.org/)__ promimises to make getting started easier.

Some other CMS platforms are more specialised. [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/) is a tool for creating non-linear, multimedia rich websites. You can use the free hosting service provided by the University of Southern California or host it yourself (Reclaim Hosting has an easy installation process; see Hosting on the Internet for details).

[Omeka](https://omeka.org/) is a platform for creating online digital exhibits. There is a parallel service, [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net/), which offers free and hosted plans for Omeka websites.

### Linked Data and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are set up by organisations that host content to allow the public to pull that content into their own applications. For instance, you might have a website that allows the user to set some criteria for grabbing images from a large database and then inserts them into the website. Since these images are stored by the host institution and not by your website, they are considered linked data. The term "linked open data" refers to content that is open access. [Serendip-o-matic](http://serendipomatic.org) and [Mirador](http://projectmirador.org/) are examples of tools that use linked data. The tools in the Blogs, Content Management Systems, and Digital Exhibit Platforms section have APIs, and the use of linked data in DH is growing.

### Installing Wordpress

If you are using a hosted service, they may have Wordpress pre-installed or have a one-click installation process. If you want to develop locally or install Wordpress yourself, it is not hard. If you are developing on your own computer, install XAMPP (see under PHP). Download Wordpress [here](https://wordpress.org/download/). Unzip it and place the Wordpress folder inside your “htdocs” folder. Make sure that MySQL is running in the XAMPP control panel (MySQL is the database used by Wordpress). Then follow the installation instructions [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). When you finish, you should have a working version of Wordpress that has none of the restrictions of Wordpress.com. Once you have configured it the way you want, you can copy it to an internet-facing server. If you are starting on a hosted service, you normally just unzip the files there.

### Social Media

Twitter is probably the best way to learn about DH. Follow some prominent DH personalities or projects, and click on the links they provide. Here are some accounts to follow (not exhaustive): [TBD].

Many DH scholars have blogs on which they discuss ongoing research (links to new posts will often be posted on Twitter). Here are some examples: [TBD]

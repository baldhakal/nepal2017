# Digital Humanities Tools and Resources

## Introduction

This guide provides download links to the major software we will be using for the Fulbright/IACER programme in June 2017. It also provides general links to useful resources.

## Text Editors

A text editor is a program that allows you to edit files in plain text format. Your operating system comes with a text editor (called Notepad on Windows) already installed, but it has limited usefulness. Since all programming languages are written in plain text, developers have created many text editors with built-in functions to help coding. You should download one of these editors for use on your own system. I recommend starting with [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). To download it, click on the link appropriate for your system (most Windows users should use the 64 bit version). To install it, double-click the icon in your downloads folder. Note: Sublime Text 3 is an evaluation version, although there is no limit on how long you can evaluate it. When you save files, you will occasionally see a request to purchase the software. You can just click **Cancel**. If you find these messages annoying, you could try Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ([Windows Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) | [Mac Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)). Installation instructions are provided on the linked pages.

Both Sublime and Visual Studio Code are powerful application with many features and options for customisation. They can be a little overwhelming. But their basic function is just to allow you to type text or code and save it.

## Web Browsers

There are many options for browsing the web. If you have a Windows machine, it will come with Microsoft's Internet Explore or, more recently, Edge. If you have a Macintosh, it will come with Safari. I do not recommend using these products (especially the Microsoft ones) since they do not always conform to internet standards. This can lead to unpredictable behaviour. For Digital Humanities work, it is best to use one of the following:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

Just click the download link, and then double-click the installation icon in your downloads folder. Firefox and Chrome frequently trade places in terms of which is most stable and which incorporates the latest web standards. You may choose whichever you prefer, but it helps to have both installed on your system.

## Office Software

"Office software" refers to suites of productivity tools, the most important of which are word processors and spreadsheet programs. The most common suite is Microsoft Office, which includes Word and Excel. If users do not have Microsoft Office, there are a number of free options, including [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/). Increasingly, Google's suite of tools in Google Drive is becoming a viable alternative, although you need a Google account. See discussion under Collaboration Tools for setting this up.

## Bibliography

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an online bibliography database which has the ability to ingest bibliographical references straight from the web and to format references according to common citation guidelines (e.g. MLA, Chicago, APA). Instructions for installing Zotero can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/installation). Zotero is also a useful tool for maintaining collaborative bibliographies. You can set up a free account and create group bibliographies online.

## Collaboration Tools

Tools for collaboration fall into a number of categories, of which a few are mentioned here.

### Collaborative Writing and Cloud Storage

There are many options out there, but the most commonly used is Google docs. If you do not already have a Google account, create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp). Once you have an account, go to [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/). This will give you access to Google Drive, the cloud storage for Google docs, sheets, and other productivity tools. You can create documents and spreadsheets and share them so that others can edit them at the same time over the web. There are many guides online for how to do this.

Because Google provides cloud storage, it overlaps with tools that are more specifically dedicated to storing files. One of the most commonly used is [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). This allows you to sync a folder on your computer to one in the cloud so that others may view or edit files stored on your local computer, and you can access them any computer with internet access. Google Drive and Dropbox have storage limitations for free access, but you are unlikely to exhaust them unless you have _very_ large amounts of data.

### Video Chat

Google Drive comes with [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), in which you can create video chat sessions over the internet for free. Microsoft's [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) is the most well-known alternative, and it may already be installed on your computer. You will need a Google or Microsoft account, respectively, to use these services.

### Team Communication Tools

These tools are something like combinations of all of the above, plus Twitter and Facebook. When you are working on a specific project, they faciliate communication between your team. The most well-known tool is [Slack](https://slack.com/is). Even if you do not have a project where you can use Slack, it is worth getting an account because there is an active Slack DH community. For more information, see Amanda Visconti's ["How the Digital Humanities uses Slack to support and build a geographically dispersed intellectual community"](http://literaturegeek.com/2016/07/13/digital-humanities-slack-london-school-economics). To join, provide your e-mail address [here](http://tinyurl.com/DHslack).

The major complaint users have about Slack is that free accounts only allow you to retain access to the 10,000 most recent posts. If that is an issue, [Ryver](https://ryver.com/) is alternative which does not place that limitation, and my students have used it successfully to communicate for group projects.

There are also applications for project management, of which [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a popular option. I have generally found Slack and Ryver more useful, but Trello is particularly good at scheduling and setting benchmarks and milestones.

### Version Control Software

In software design, it is of utmost importance to have a history of modifications to the code (version control), but this can be useful for traditional writing projects as well. The computer programming industry has produced software for version control, of which the most popular is "git". This should not be confused with [GitHub](https://github.com/), which uses git to manage content in a cloud storage system. GitHub is probably the most commonly used platform for managing software "repositories" with version control. In fact, the document you are reading now is housed in a GitHub repository. The system works like this. You have a file on your local computer which is synced to a repository on GitHub. If you modify the file, you can "commit" the changes and then "push" them to the repository. If you decide that you didn't want the changes, you can role them back using git.

GitHub has a number of advantages:

1. It has a website and client applications which allow you to perform many git functions without learning git, which is not always easy. To get started, follow the tutorial [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You can download the client [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. GitHub has free public cloud storage. You'll need a paid plan if you want private repositories). DH is ideologically committed to open access, so this is rarely a problem.
3. GitHub has a social media-like "Issues" feature which is great for collaboration.
4. GitHub also has an optional features called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to host a website in a GitHub repository.

It can take time to get familiar with git and GitHub, but it is definitely worth it.

### Command-Line Access

Nothing to download here. These are just some links to how to access and use the command prompt. In Windows, press the \f17a &#8862; + `R` to bring up the **Run** box and type `cmd.exe` into the text field. Then hit the `Enter` key. A black command prompt window should appear. You can also type &#8862; + `X` and then `C` for short. On a Mac, the command prompt is called the **terminal**. To access it, run the cursor to the top of the screen to expose the menu bar. Then click the Spotlight icon (magnifying glass) at the top right. Alternatively, you can press &#8984; + `Space`. Start typing "terminal" in the search field. After two or three characters, the terminal icon will appear.

### Text Analysis Tools

Text analysis tools use various methods to manipulate and study text files. They may be web-based (run through a web browser), desktop tools, or they may be run through the command line.
